# Product/Usability Review: Is Descartes Too Complex?

**Date**: 2025-12-06T21:16:35Z
**Researcher**: reuben
**Git Commit**: 1f6145b7958ccd0fbcd8b13ea286620b8043a3de
**Branch**: master
**Repository**: cap

## Research Question

Is this too complex for usability? Review from a product/feature perspective for intelligent, capable developers.

---

## Executive Summary: **No, but with caveats**

Descartes has **excellent onboarding simplicity** (2-command start) but **hidden depth that could overwhelm** if a developer encounters the full surface area too early. The product follows a **progressive disclosure** philosophy that works—if you let it.

**Verdict**: Appropriately complex for power users. Not too complex for intelligent developers.

---

## The Good: Minimal Entry Points

### Time to First Agent: ~2 minutes

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
descartes spawn --task "Fix the type error in main.rs"
```

This is excellent. No wizard, no configuration file, no account creation. One env var, one command.

### Core Philosophy is Sound

| Principle | Implementation | UX Impact |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **4 tools** (read, write, edit, bash) | Genuinely minimal | Low cognitive load |
| **Skills via bash** | Progressive disclosure | Pay-as-you-go complexity |
| **JSON transcripts** | Automatic, unobtrusive | Debugging without configuration |
| **Recursive spawn prevention** | Built into tool levels | No footgun |

### Self-Diagnostic is a Smart Pattern

```bash
descartes doctor
```

Outputs exactly what's configured, what's missing, and what to do next. This eliminates the "why isn't it working?" cycle.

---

## The Concerns: Where Complexity Hides

### 1. Two Products in One Repository

The codebase contains **two distinct experiences**:

1. **Descartes CLI** - The minimal AI agent runner
2. **Claude Code Workflow (`/cl:*`)** - A structured dev workflow built on top

These are related but serve different use cases:

| Aspect | Descartes CLI | `/cl:*` Workflow |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Target | Quick agent spawning | Structured feature development |
| Complexity | Low (10 commands) | Medium (6 commands + agents) |
| Output | Session transcripts | Research docs, plans, commits |
| Learning curve | 5 minutes | 30+ minutes |

**Risk**: A developer encountering both simultaneously may be confused about which to use.

**Mitigation needed**: Clear documentation on "use Descartes for X, use `/cl:*` workflow for Y"

### 2. Config File Has Deep Gravity

The config file (`~/.descartes/config.toml`) has **8+ sections** and **50+ fields**:

```toml
[providers]           # 6 sub-sections
[providers.anthropic] # 11 fields each
[agent]               # 12 fields
[storage]             # 15+ fields
[security]            # 9 fields
[notifications]       # 6 fields
[features]            # 5 fields
[logging]             # 4 fields
```

**BUT**: You don't need any of this to start. The default config is generated by `descartes init`.

**Risk**: A developer who opens the config file may feel they need to understand it all.

**Current mitigation**: Config is optional (env vars work), defaults are sensible.

### 3. GUI Has 9 Views

The native GUI (`descartes-gui`) exposes:

1. Sessions
2. Dashboard
3. Chat
4. TaskBoard
5. SwarmMonitor
6. Debugger
7. DagEditor
8. FileBrowser
9. KnowledgeGraph

**For intelligent developers**: This is power, not complexity. Each view solves a real problem.

**Risk**: First-time GUI users may not know where to start.

**Mitigation needed**: A "start here" view or guided tour.

### 4. Swarm Workflows Require State Machine Knowledge

The `swarm.toml` workflow definition:

```toml
[[workflows]]
name = "approval_flow"

[workflows.states.pending_review]
description = "Waiting for human approval"
entry_actions = ["notify"]
agents = ["notifier"]

[[workflows.states.pending_review.handlers]]
event = "approved"
target = "implementing"
guards = ["has_assignee"]
```

This is genuinely complex. It assumes familiarity with:
- State machines
- Event-driven architectures
- Guard conditions

**BUT**: This is an advanced feature. Most users will never need it.

**Risk**: If showcased too early in docs, it signals "this is complicated"

**Mitigation needed**: Move swarm docs to an "Advanced" section, not the main README.

## Complexity Audit: Commands

### Descartes CLI (10 commands)

| Command | Flags | Complexity | Essential? |
|---------|-------|------------|------------|
| `spawn` | 8 | Medium | Yes |
| `ps` | 2 | Low | Yes |
| `kill` | 2 | Low | Yes |
| `pause` | 2 | Low | No |
| `resume` | 1 | Low | No |
| `attach` | 4 | Medium | No |
| `logs` | 5 | Medium | Yes |
| `doctor` | 0 | Trivial | Yes |
| `init` | 2 | Low | Sometimes |
| `tasks` | 5 subcommands | Medium | No |

**Essential commands for daily use**: 4 (spawn, ps, kill, doctor)

**Verdict**: Right-sized. Power users have options, beginners have a minimal surface.

### `/cl:*` Workflow (6 commands)

| Command | Purpose | Complexity |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `/cl:research_codebase_nt` | Understand code | Low (1 arg) |
| `/cl:create_plan_nt` | Write plan | Low (1 arg) |
| `/cl:iterate_plan_nt` | Update plan | Low (1 arg) |
| `/cl:implement_plan` | Execute plan | Low (1 arg) |
| `/cl:commit` | Commit changes | Trivial |
| `/cl:describe_pr` | Write PR desc | Trivial |

**Verdict**: Excellent simplicity. Each command does one thing.

## Usability Comparison

| Aspect | Descartes | Claude Code (reference) | Aider (reference) |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Time to first run | ~2 min | ~5 min | ~3 min |
| Required config | 1 env var | Installation + auth | 1 env var |
| Core commands | 4 essential | ~15 | ~10 |
| Tools available | 4 | 40+ | 10+ |
| Extension model | Skills (bash) | MCP servers | Python plugins |
| Observability | Full transcripts | Limited logs | Git history |

---

## Target User Analysis

### Who Will Thrive

1. **Senior engineers** who want observable, minimal tooling
2. **CLI-first developers** comfortable with bash
3. **Teams with existing tool ecosystems** (skills model fits well)
4. **Security-conscious developers** (controlled spawning, full transcripts)

### Who May Struggle

1. **Developers expecting IDE integration** - No VS Code extension (yet)
2. **Teams wanting "just works" defaults** - Some provider config needed
3. **Non-technical stakeholders** - No web UI for collaboration

---

## Recommendations for Improved Usability

### 1. Clear Product Boundaries

Add to README:
```
## When to Use What

- **Quick task?** → `descartes spawn --task "..."`
- **Feature development?** → `/cl:create_plan_nt` → `/cl:implement_plan`
- **Just exploring?** → `descartes spawn --task "..." --tool-level readonly`
```

### 2. Progressive Documentation

Current structure reveals complexity too early. Suggested order:

1. Quickstart (exists, good)
2. Core commands (spawn, ps, logs, doctor)
3. Tool levels (minimal, orchestrator, readonly)
4. Skills system
5. Advanced: Config file, GUI, swarm workflows

### 3. First-Run Experience

The `descartes doctor` output could include:
```
Suggested first command:
  descartes spawn --task "Explain what this project does"
```

### 4. GUI Onboarding

Add a "Getting Started" modal or default to Dashboard view with quick actions:
- Start new session
- View recent transcripts
- Check system health

## Conclusion

**Is it too complex?** No.

**Why not?**
1. Entry point is genuinely minimal (1 env var, 1 command)
2. Progressive disclosure works—you don't see complexity until you need it
3. Core philosophy (4 tools, skills via bash, transcripts) is coherent
4. Target audience (intelligent developers) can handle the depth

**What would make it better?**
1. Clearer separation between "Descartes CLI" and "/cl:* workflow"
2. Advanced features (swarm, GUI) moved to separate docs section
3. First-run guidance that suggests next steps

**For intelligent, capable developers**: This is appropriately complex. The learning curve matches the power.
